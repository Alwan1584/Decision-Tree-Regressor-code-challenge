# Decision-Tree-Regressor-code-challenge  
In this code challenge, I used a data set of the world population from 1960 to 2017  
I performed some operations on the data inorder to get the relevant variables that would be used to train the decision tree regressor model  
then tested the model on some training data.  
After testing, the model's accuracy and perfomance was evaluated using the the Root Mean Squared Logarithic Error.
